Mac OS X
--------

Install XCode from the App Store.


GNU/Linux
---------

Install the GNU C (gcc) and C++ (g++) compilers, development libraries for
libssl, python and curl.

On Debian and Ubuntu GNU/Linux, install the following packages::

  $ sudo apt-get install build-essential libssl-dev python curl


All Platforms
-------------

Bootstrap the buildout with the standard system Python like this::

  $ /usr/bin/python bootstrap.py

It uses buildout 1.4.4, everything after that is currently unsupported.

Run buildout like this afterwards::

  $ ./bin/buildout

Now you can use the Python executables in ``python-2.4/bin/python2.4``, etc.
